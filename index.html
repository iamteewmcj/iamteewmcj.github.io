    <p>
      <strong>Astana</strong>, previously known as Akmolinsk, Tselinograd, Akmola, and most
      recently Nur-Sultan, is the capital city of Kazakhstan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city lies on the banks of the Ishim River in the north-central part of
      Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administered as a city with
      special status separately from the rest of the region. A 2020 official
      estimate reported a population of 1,136,008 within the city limits, making
      it the second-largest city in the country, after Almaty, which had been
      the capital until 1997. The city became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997;
      since then it has grown and developed economically into one of the most
      modern cities in Central Asia. In 2021, the government selected Astana as
      one of the 10 priority destinations for tourist development.

      Modern Astana is a planned city, following the process of other planned
      capitals. After it became the capital of Kazakhstan, the city dramatically
      changed its shape. The city's master-plan was designed by Japanese
      architect Kisho Kurokawa. As the seat of the government of Kazakhstan,
      Astana is the site of the Parliament House, Supreme Court, Ak Orda
      Presidential Palace and numerous government departments and agencies. It
      is home to a range of futuristic buildings, including many skyscrapers.
